                               General Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The directory contains Java source files related to DENOPTIM and related 
programs.

src: The src directory contains the source code:      

    DENOPTIM: Generic library of functions and data structures that can be 
              used by other programs.

    DenoptimGA: The Genetic Algorithm engine that uses the DENOPTIM library  
                for molecular design.

    DenoptimRND: The Evolutionary Algorithms using only random selection of
                new members.

    DenoptimCG: The 3D conformation generator. Requires standard or
                RCP-capable (for DENOPTIM runs performing ring-closures) to
                be installed.

    The "misc" directory contains other miscellaneous utilities that may be 
    used as part of a workflow based on DENOPTIM. In the general scheme of 
    things, programs that contain multiple source files have been stored in 
    a single directory while those using single source files are placed in 
    the "misc" directory.
    The "misc" directory contains the following tools: 

        PrepareMOPAC: A utility that uses a script based interface to prepare
                the input for MOPAC.

	CheckCatalystConstraints: A Java-based utility that reads the output 
		from a MOPAC based geometry optimization, calculates the 
		descriptors based on which the catalytic efficiency is 
		predicted. Additional checks for any constraint violations 
		are also performed and the results are written to the 
		specified output file. Reads options from a text file. 

	EVA: Calculation of spectroscopic QSAR descriptors from the 
		vibrational frequencies and molecular orbital energies. 

	CheckAnchor: A utility that checks if the dye molecule designed by 
		DENOPTIM contains an anchoring group (list of acceptable 
		groups is for now hard-coded).

	GetMOPACCoordinates: A utility to read the MOPAC output and extract 
		the 3D coordinates. 

	PrepareFitnessOutput: A utility for preparing a formatted SDF file. 
		Parameters are supplied in a text file. 

	RDKITFragmenter: A python program that uses the RDKit library to 
		create fragments. A java program SetupBRICS that provides a 
		DENOPTIM readable fragment file by parsing the output from 
		the RDKITFragmenter. 

lib: The lib directory contains all third-party libraries that are used by
     DENOPTIM and/or other programs. NOTE: All such libraries must be placed
     in  this library.

data: the data folder contains sample input and fitness evaluation scripts, 
fragment files, compatibility matrix, R-scripts for QSPR models. JavaScript 
and CSS files that are used by the HTML5 viewer for 3D molecular 
representation. DO NOT STORE BINARY FILES. 

doc: the documentation folder contains the DENOPTIM manual, a template for 
making fitness-scripts and some extra documentation.

                        Compiling the source
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separate shell scripts have been created to compile the programs. In addition 
a "build-all" script has been provided that compiles all the programs.
All compiled programs can be finally stored in the "dist" directory which is 
created by the script.

To compile all programs simply type 
    cd build
    bash build-all.sh 
         or
    bash build-all.sh makedist (this creates a distribution directory)
    
To compile specific programs simply type     
    cd build
    # subtitute the <programname> as required
    bash build-<programname>.sh 
    
NOTE: If any changes are made to the dependent libraries (for eg CDK and 
      DENOPTIM) please recompile all associated programs, for the changes to
      be effective.

                        Creating QSPR models using R
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
R-scripts have been provided for the calculation of QSPR models. 

To create the models (binary format)
   cd directory_containing_the_script
   /usr/bin/Rscript script-name
   

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              CONTRIB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The contrib directory contains contributed code to be used typically as a 
post-processing step of DENOPTIM. 

To compile the programs simply type 
    cd contrib/build
    bash build-gendenoptimftree.sh
