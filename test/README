WARNING! The standard maximum valence (maxval) of TINKER has to be increased 
         to be capable of running "t2" and other tests using DenoptimCG. 
         Set "maxval=12" in the sizes.i of the TINKER source and recompile.

WARNING! Generation of ring closing conformations with DenoptimCG requires
         a modified version of TINKER implementing the Ring Closing Potential.
         See J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1844-1856.

WARNING! There is no automated evaluation of the outcome of tests t1, t2, t3, 
         and t4.
         For now is up to the user to check the results.
