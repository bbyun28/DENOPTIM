WARNING! The standard maximum valence (maxval) of TINKER has to be increased 
         to be capable of running "t2" and other tests using DenoptimCG. 
         Set "maxval=12" in the sizes.i of the TINKER source and recompile.

WARNING! Generation of ring closing conformations with DenoptimCG requires
         a modified version of TINKER implementing the Ring Closing Potential.
         See J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1844-1856.

WARNING! There is no automated evaluation of the outcome of tests t1, t2, t3, 
         and t4.
         For now is up to the user to check the results.

# Description of the tests
#

PtCOLX2: publshed test case for evolutionary experiments.

t1: Test for DenoptimCG (requires Tinker-RC).

t2: Application specific - test fitness provider script (requires Tinker-RC).

t3: Evolutionary experiment with ring-closures in 3D (requires Tinker-RC).

t4: Exploration of fragment space with ring-closures in 3D (requires Tinker-RC).

t5: Exploration of fragment space from given root graphs and ring-closures (no 3D).

t6: Exploration of fragment space with enforced symmetry and ring-closures (no 3D).

t7: Exploration of fragment space from a given set root graphs.

t8: Exploration of fragment space.

t9: Restart exploration of fragment space from checkpoint file.

t10: Restart exploration of fragment space from checkpoint file.

t11: Test "SerConverter", which parses a serialized graph. NB: this test need a serialized file generated with the same version of DENOPTIM.

t12: Test "CheckpointReader", which reads a checkpoint file.

t13: Exploration of fragment space with symmetry constraints.

t14: Exploration of fragment space with enforced symmetry.

t15: Evolution with enforced symmetry.

t16: Evolution with symmetry constraints.

t17: Preserve symmetry sets found in initial molecules throughout evolution.

t18: Crossover operator with an acyclic graph.

t19: Crossover operator with a cyclic graph.

t20: Test "GraphEditor", which takes an existing DENOPTINGraph, replaces a vertex with a new one, and deletes another vertex.
