# README file for test 't7' of DENOPTIM package
#

The binary file used in this test has been created with the SVN revision 8952.
Substantial changed to the DENOPTIM's objects may require
updating the input and data files used by this test. The files under folder 'p6'
in combination with the use of developers-only code (see 'PREPARECHKFORTEST'
in class CombinatorialExplorerByLayer.java of the FragSpaceExplorer package) can
be used to generate a new set of binaries for this test.
