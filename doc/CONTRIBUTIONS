#Contributions: Testing and debugging DENOPTIM library
Design of class-based approach: use of chemical information to define compatibility of attachment points.
Implementation of the first class-based builder (TreeBuilder modulus for DENOPTIM-0.1). This functionality has been moved to DenoptimGA after integration into a newer versions of DENOPTIM (performed by Vish).
Test and debug of class-based building process and class-based genetic operators.
Design of full-3D approach: construction of 3D model from 3D fragments. Contribution to implementation of 3D building process. Testing and debugging of DenoptimCG. Upgrade.
Design and implementation of ring-closing denoptim.
Upgrade of DENOPTIM library to include handling of 3D.
Design and implementation of extension for combinatorial design (FragSpaceExplorer)
